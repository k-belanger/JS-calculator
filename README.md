## JS Challenge for Flock

## Problem Set #2 (Calculator): 
## Using test driven development, implement a single calculator object that does: multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction, operations.


## My Notes:
Notes:
- clear button and decimals DO work
- All key numbers and operators DO work
- includes working UI (open calculator.html in a browser)


Limitations and Bugs at this time:
- it only can perform exquations in the following format: number operator number = answer. 
Examples:
205 + 1005 = 1210
2.5 x 1.75 = 4.375
- numbers that are too long for the screen will break out of the box



Next Steps I would have taken:
- rework calculator function so it could take multiple numbers and operators
- decrease font size of screen numbers if they were over a certain character limit, and/or display and Err if the number was too long for the screen.
